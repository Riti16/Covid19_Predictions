**Overview:** 
- Predicting COVID-19 cases using an exponential smoothing model and evaluating the accuracy of the predictions.


**Method in Brief:**
- Fetching historical COVID-19 data from a CSV file (total_cases_data.csv), performing exponential smoothing using the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) algorithm from the Statsmodels library, and then predicting future cases.
- After making predictions, reading another CSV file (predicted_data.csv) containing manually specified predicted values for certain dates ("26/3/2020", "27/3/2020", "28/3/2020"). It merges the actual and predicted data, calculates accuracy percentages, and computes the mean accuracy.


**Code Breakdown:**

1. Data Preparation:
The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, json, MySQL connector, datetime, requests, and statsmodels.
It reads a CSV file (total_cases_data.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame (covid_pred).
The time series data is then prepared with a logarithmic transformation (data['logTotal'] = np.log(data.Total)) to stabilize variance and handle potential non-constant variance.

2. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression:
The OLS algorithm is used to perform linear regression on the logarithmically transformed time series data.
sm.OLS from the Statsmodels library is employed, where the dependent variable (y) is the logarithm of the total cases (logTotal), and the independent variable (X) is a constant term along with the time variable.
The regression model is then fitted (res=mod.fit()), and the summary statistics are printed (print(res.summary())).

3. Exponential Smoothing Parameters:
After fitting the OLS model, the script extracts the initial value exponent (initial_value_exponent) and growth factor exponent (growth_factor_exponent) from the OLS results.
These exponents are then used to calculate the initial value (X0) and growth factor (b) for the exponential smoothing model.

4. Prediction:
The script sets a start date (2020-03-02) and calculates the number of days (time) between the start date and the current date.
Using the exponential smoothing formula (Xt = X0 * (math.pow(b,time))), it predicts the total cases for the next day (tomorrow).
The predicted value is then rounded to get an integer value.

5. Accuracy Evaluation:
The script reads another CSV file (predicted_data.csv) containing manually specified predicted values for certain dates.
It merges the actual and predicted data based on the date.
For the specified dates, the accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the smaller value to the larger value, multiplied by 100.
The mean accuracy is calculated for the specified dates.

In summary, the code uses OLS regression to estimate initial values and growth factors, and then applies exponential smoothing to predict future COVID-19 cases. The accuracy of the predictions is evaluated by comparing them with manually specified values for specific dates.
